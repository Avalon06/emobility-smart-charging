### Description
This repository is an implementation of smart charging for electric vehicles (EVs). It contains a charging optimizer which schedules EVs for charging throughout the day. 
The optimization algorithm addresses the following goals: 
- Main goal: Ensure all EVs are charged at the end of the day while respecting infrastructure constraints
- Secondary goal: Minimize peak load (avoid peaks in power consumption)
- Secondary goal: Minimize electricity prices (charge EVs at times when electricity is cheap if prices vary)

Refer to [1] for a detailed explanation of the algorithm. 

On a technical note, this repository contains the following components: 
- The algorithm for charging optimization (implemented in Java)
- A server with a REST API for accessing the algorithm (implemented with Spring Boot)
- A frontend "playground" application to test REST API input parameters and check results (implemented with Angular 8)
- A Dockerfile to containerize the components described above

### Requirements
The application may be run either with or without Docker. 

#### With Docker 
The application can be containerized using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and the `Dockerfile` in this repository. If the application is run via Docker the other requirements may be ignored. 

#### Without Docker
The server requires Java and the dependency management tool [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/). 
The minimum required Java version is Java 8. 

Enter `java -version` and `mvn -version` in your command line to test your installation. 

The frontend is optional. The server and its REST API will work without the frontend. 
The requirements for the frontend are [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and its package manager NPM. 

Enter `node --version` and `npm --version` in your command line to test your installation. 



### Download and Installation
#### With Docker
The simplest way to run this application is to use Docker and the `Dockerfile` in this repository. 
This will compile the server and the frontend. 

First, build the Docker image (this may take a few minutes). 
[Parameters](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/): 
- `-t` Tag the image with a name
``` 
docker build -t emobility_smart_charging .
```

Next, start the application by running the container (the server runs on port 8080). 
[Parameters](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/): 
- `-d` Detached mode: Run container in the background
- `-p` Publish a container's port to the host: Change the first port in `8080:8080` to adjust which port you want the application to run on
```
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 emobility_smart_charging
```

#### Without Docker
This section is relevant if the application should be run without Docker, for example for development purposes. 

First, compile the server: 
```
mvn clean install
```

(Optional) Prepare and compile the frontend: 
```
cd frontend/
npm install
npm run build:playground
```

Start the server (from the root directory of the repository): 
```
java -jar target/emobility-smart-charging-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

#### Accessing the application
After you have started the application it can be accessed via [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/). 
The frontend can be accessed via [/playground/index.html](http://localhost:8080/playground/index.html). 
The API documentation is implemented via Swagger and can be accessed via [/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html). 


#### Generate TypeScript mappings (optional)
If you plan to use the API in a project which uses TypeScript you can generate the expected types of API requests and responses using the following command: 
``` 
mvn typescript-generator:generate
```
This approach is used in the frontend. Type declarations are generated in the file `frontend/src/assets/server_types.d.ts`. 


### Known Issues
Please refer to the list of [issues](../../issues) on GitHub.


### How to obtain support
Please use the [GitHub issue tracker](../../issues) for any questions, bug reports, feature requests, etc.



### To-Do (upcoming changes) 
- Provide translation of charging profiles to the Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) 1.6 or 2.0 
- Provide standard car model parameters
